## Data Structure Example
All department pages follow a similar data structure:

```typescript
const stats = [
  { title: 'Metric 1', value: 'X', change: '+Y', icon: 'üìä' },
  { title: 'Metric 2', value: 'X', change: '+Y', icon: 'üíº' },
  { title: 'Metric 3', value: 'X', change: '+Y', icon: 'üìà' },
  { title: 'Metric 4', value: 'X%', change: '+Y%', icon: '‚úÖ' }
];

const [data] = useState([
  { id: 'XX-001', field1: 'value', field2: 'value', ... },
  // ... more items
]);

// Search and pagination
const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
const pageSize = 5;

// Filtered and paginated data
const filteredData = useMemo(() => {
  return data.filter(item => /* search logic */);
}, [search, data]);

const paginatedData = useMemo(() => {
  const start = (page - 1) * pageSize;
  return filteredData.slice(start, start + pageSize);
}, [filteredData, page]);
```

## Next Steps
1. Create the remaining 6 department pages using FundManagement.tsx and CreditRisk.tsx as templates
2. Add their imports and routes to App.tsx
3. Ensure all pages have realistic dummy data
4. Test navigation and search/pagination functionality
5. Verify mobile responsiveness
6. Update the Monitoring Department page to integrate with existing monitoring team pages

## Notes
- All department names use "Department" suffix (e.g., "Fund Management Department")
- Full name for "Dept" is "Department" throughout
- The Monitoring Department should provide an overview and link to the 4 monitoring team levels
- Each page should have 10-15 realistic data entries for demonstration
- Search should work across multiple fields (ID, name, status, etc.)
- Pagination should show 4-6 items per page depending on content density
